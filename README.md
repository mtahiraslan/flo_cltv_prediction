## What is CLV?

Customer lifetime value (CLV) is a measure of the total income a business can expect to bring in from a typical customer for as long as that person or account remains a client.

When measuring CLV, itâ€™s best to look at the total average revenue generated by a customer and the total average profit. Each provides important insights into how customers interact with your business and if your overall marketing plan is working as expected.

## Business Problem

FLO wants to determine roadmap for sales and marketing activities. In order for the company to make a medium long -term plan, it is necessary to estimate the potential value that existing customers will provide to the company in the future.
